## Introduction

This project aims to explore and analyze the Amazon dataset obtained from Kaggle. The primary objectives include understanding sales trends, sizes sold, popular categories, courier statistics, and other relevant metrics to gain insights into Amazon's operations.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information regarding Amazon sales, including:

- T-shirt sizes sold
- Courier statistics
- Histogram of sizes
- Histogram of clothing categories
- Sales per B2B (Business-to-Business) transactions
- Pie chart illustrating fulfillment by Amazon and merchants
- Scatter plot depicting the relationship between size and category
- Bar graph showcasing sales across different states
- Top 10 states with the highest sales count

## Analysis and Visualizations

### Data Cleaning

The initial step involved cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies that might affect the analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Countplot on T-shirt Sizes Sold:** Visualized the distribution of T-shirt sizes sold to understand the popular sizes among consumers.

- **Courier Statistics:** Explored courier-related data to analyze the performance and efficiency of different courier services utilized by Amazon.

- **Histogram of Sizes:** Examined the distribution of sizes across all products to identify any size preferences among customers.

- **Histogram on Categories of Clothes:** Investigated the frequency of different clothing categories to identify popular product categories.

- **Sales per B2B Pie Chart:** Visualized the proportion of sales attributed to B2B transactions using a pie chart.

- **Pie Chart on Fulfillment of Amazon and Merchant:** Compared the fulfillment of orders by Amazon itself versus third-party merchants.

- **Scatter Plot on Size and Category:** Explored the relationship between the size of products and their corresponding categories.

- **Bar Graph on States:** Analyzed sales performance across different states to identify regions with significant sales volumes.

- **Top 10 States with Count:** Highlighted the top 10 states with the highest sales count to pinpoint areas of strong market presence.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into Amazon's sales data, highlighting patterns, preferences, and trends among consumers. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the analysis and visualizations offer actionable insights that can aid in strategic decision-making for Amazon's business operations. Further analysis and machine learning models could be developed to predict future trends and optimize various aspects of Amazon's operations based on the findings from this analysis.
